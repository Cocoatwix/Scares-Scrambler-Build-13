Hey! Thanks for trying out the Scares Scramber! If you're not sure how to work this thing,
then go watch this tutorial or something idk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOQykOsMeEU

If you think the corrupter has frozen, give it a couple seconds. Since Python is an interpreted
language, the corrupter may be a bit slow when corrupting bigger files. It is possible that we
missed a bug in the code, so if you really, really think it crashed, then don't be afraid to tell
me or look in the code to investigate!

Like it says in the about window, feel free to mess around in the source code and add your own
things. If you want to release your own modified version, just be sure to give me credit somewhere,
and I'll be happy! :)

Last point, and I think this one is obvious. This corrupter is still very young (one year to be exact).
There's probably a whole bunch of bugs that slipped through me and the bugtesters. Don't expect this to
work 100% perfectly yet.

Anyways, that's really all I have to say. Enjoy the corrupter!

PS: I forgot to add Ellex's and Tyler's names to the bugtesters. They helped as well!
